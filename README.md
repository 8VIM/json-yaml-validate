A GitHub Action to quickly validate JSON and YAML files in a repository

## About ðŸ’¡

This action comes pre-packaged with two different common JSON and YAML validators:

- JSON validation with [ajv](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv) - The fastest NodeJS JSON validator
- YAML validation with [yaml-schema-validator](https://github.com/ketanSaxena/schema-validator)

If you have a repository containing JSON or YAML files and want to validate them extremely quickly, this action is for you!

You can provide schemas to check against, or just validate the syntax of the files. This comes very handy when you want to ensure that your JSON and YAML files are valid before committing them to your repository, especially from pull requests.

## Inputs ðŸ“¥

| Input | Required? | Default | Description |

| `mode` | `false` | `"fail"` | The mode to run the action in `"warn"` or `"fail"` - Default is `"fail"` |
| `base_dir` | `false` | `"."` | The base directory to search for JSON and YAML files (e.g. ./src) - Default is `"."` which searches the entire repository |
| `json_schema` | `false` | `""` | The full path to the JSON schema file (e.g. ./schemas/schema.json) - Default is `""` which doesn't enforce a strict schema |
| `json_extension` | `false` | `".json"` | The file extension for JSON files (e.g. .json) - Default is `".json"` |
